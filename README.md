## Project Overview

This repository is a comprehensive workshop aimed at helping developers understand and apply:

- **Frontend Development:** How to organize your code for scalability and maintainability.
- **React Fundamentals:** Using functional components, hooks, and props to build interactive user interfaces.
- **JavaScript Practices:** Mastering array methods, optional chaining, destructuring, and more.

The project is set up using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development, along with ESLint configurations to ensure code quality.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gah-code-react-workshop.git
   cd gah-code-react-workshop
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**

   Start the Vite development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by Vite).

4. **Lint Your Code:**

   Use the included ESLint configuration to check your code quality:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

---

## Development Workflow

- **Code Editing:** Use your favorite code editor (VSCode, Atom, etc.) and take advantage of ESLint for real-time code feedback.
- **Component Structure:** Organize React components into logical folders. Reuse components and keep them as small and focused as possible.
- **Version Control:** Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages.

---

## Best Practices

### JavaScript Best Practices

- **Modular Code:** Break your code into reusable modules. Use the `javascript/` folder to experiment with array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and more.
- **Destructuring & ES6:** Leverage ES6 features such as destructuring, arrow functions, and template literals to write concise and readable code.
- **Optional Chaining:** Safely access nested object properties using optional chaining (`?.`) to prevent runtime errors.
- **Immutable Data:** Avoid mutating data directly—use methods that return new arrays or objects instead.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Rely on ESLint (with our provided configuration) to maintain a consistent code style across the project.

### React Best Practices

- **Functional Components & Hooks:** Prefer functional components over class-based ones. Use hooks (like `useState` and `useEffect`) to manage component state and side effects.
- **Props and One-Way Data Flow:** Pass data from parent to child components using props. Remember that props are read-only—any data that needs to change should be managed in state.
- **Component Organization:** Keep components small and focused. Split large components into smaller ones to enhance readability and reusability.
- **State Management:** Use React’s built-in state for local component data. For more complex state, consider context or external libraries.
- **Clear File Structure:** Organize your project with separate folders for components, assets, and examples. Refer to the `react-props/` and `src/` folders for sample implementations.
- **CSS in JS / Modules:** Maintain styling using CSS modules or styled-components to encapsulate styles with components, preventing style conflicts.
- **Documentation:** Include comments and documentation (as seen in the `practice.md` and `notes.md` files) to explain your logic and decisions.
